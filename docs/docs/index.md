## **The project** ðŸ›°

The GOEASY project will provide the technical and business foundations to enable a new generation of trusted and dependable mass-market Location Based Services and Applications to engage, stimulate and reward citizens for more sustainable behaviours and healthier choices.

This three-years project contributes to the consolidation of an environmentally aware and engaged public community in the EU, while delivering added value innovative solutions for Location Based Services and opening new scenarios and opportunities for Smart  City solutions (by enabling innovative LBS and IoT services). The research outputs are relevant for EU citizens lives, promoting a healthier environment, increasing sustainability in cities, creating employment opportunities and improving existing technologies.

GNSS user technology is now widely available in mass market devices including personal devices, connected vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT) objects, etc. The widespread availability of GNSS receivers, joint with ubiquitous communication capabilities of devices and the ability of cloud-based ICT platforms to federate with each other through open standards and APIs, is enabling a new generation of Location Based Services (LBS) able to support highly-scalable pervasive applications where large number of geographically-distributed users are engaged e.g. in immersive games and commercial services.

While GNSS proves to be able to support such applications successfully, a major drawback prevents such approach to be used in more serious (and potentially highly rewarding) mass market applications i.e. the lack of authentication features, resulting in high difficulties in preventing users from spoofing position information to gain advantages or damage other users.

GOEASY will be evaluated by means of two concrete use cases, namely the ApesMobility and the AsthmaWatch, both evaluated engaging real users in a medium-scale pilot in Torino (Italy) and Stockholm (Sweden).
